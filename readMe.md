# Study on the Barcelona airbnb dataset :
This summer i'm planning to go to Barcelona which is my favorite city, so i wanted to see the prices of the airbnbs there.

## Data source :
I found [this amazing dataset on kaggle] https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/analysis-of-barcelona-airbnb-listings , and decided to clean it and work on it.


## Tools: 
I wrote my study as a JuPyTer notebook , and used 3 of my favorites python libraries for dataviz which are Pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.



## END
